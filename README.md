# County-Level Choropleth of Reptile Observations in the (Continental) US

Fun script to plot total reptile observations in each US county.

Data are available in the script by a DOI link to GBIF. Filtered data included in the final plot include ~457,000 reptile observations. 

Lots of areas for improvement, especially in (potentially) retaining more data from the original download, and figuring out what's driving weird patterns, like the pulse of reptiles apparently active in Massachusets in January. 

Suggestions for improvement are welcome!
