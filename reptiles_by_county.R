# The data were downloaded from the GBIF website (APIs have a hard limit of 200k observations). The dataset has ~357000 inat observation, ~668000 preserved specimens https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.8nheu2

# Search criteria were squamates, with basis of record as human observation, material sample, preserved specimen or unknown within a square of the US (Geometry POLYGON((-129.03717 23.74387,-63.53119 23.74387,-63.53119 49.9415,-129.03717 49.9415,-129.03717 23.74387))), that have coordinates, and where Has geospatial issue false

# Loading the data takes a while, time it. 
# From previous loads, the majority of observations have no county data, or very poorly regulated names ("Coconino", "Coconino County", "coconino", "Cocconino" etc.). All have at least lat long, so let's just focus on those.
# Just take the needed columns to save memory
